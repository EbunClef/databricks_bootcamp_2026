# Databricks Bootcamp 2026
Welcome to the Databricks Data Lakehouse Project inspired by Data With Baraa.

This repository contains a complete, real-world Data Lakehouse implementation built on Databricks, including datasets, notebooks, SQL, and answers to exercises. Everything here is designed to understand how modern data teams use Databricks in practice, from data ingestion and transformation to analytics-ready data products.
